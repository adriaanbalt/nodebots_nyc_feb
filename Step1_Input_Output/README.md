# TROUBLESHOOTING

##Hardware
If the clicking the button doesn't light up the LED, make sure you declared the correct pin for your led

##Software
If the button doesn't start the LED, make sure your HTML page can load jQuery properly. 
Open the browser console and see if it prints "you clicked the button!" and it can access the board, 
you should see "XHR finished loading: GET"
